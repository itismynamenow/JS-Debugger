# JS-Debugger
Simple debugger API to debug JS ES5 code in browser without any kind of developer tools. 
The thing is based on [JS-Interpreter](https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter). My code is basically wrapper that provide simple API that debuggers have today (stepping trough code, setting breakpoints, obtaining current scope and call stack etc.). For better understanding check out demo page https://itismynamenow.github.io/JS-Debugger/.
